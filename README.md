Playdoh: pure Python library for distributed computing and optimization 
=======================================================================

Playdoh is a pure Python library for distributing computations across the 
free computing units (CPUs and GPUs) available in a small network of 
multicore computers. Playdoh supports independent (embarassingly) parallel 
problems as well as loosely coupled tasks such as global optimizations, 
Monte Carlo simulations and numerical integration of partial differential 
equations. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use and should be of 
interest to scientists wanting to turn their lab computers into a small 
cluster at no cost.
