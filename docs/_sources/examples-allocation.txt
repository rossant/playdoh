resources on the servers.
The Playdoh server must run on the local machine and on
the default port (2718 by default)
for this script to work.

    from playdoh import *
    
    
    # It can also be a list of server IP addresses
    servers = 'localhost'
    
    # Allocate automatically the maximum number of resources on the
    # specified servers
    alloc = allocate(servers)
    
    # alloc is an Allocation object, it can be used as a dictionary
    for machine, count in alloc.iteritems():
        print "%d CPUs allocated on machine %s" % (count, str(machine))
